**Feature Branch**: `001-an-automated-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "An automated system receives emails from SendGrid, uses a zero-shot AI model to classify them against a user-managed, hierarchical list of categories, and organizes them to improve workflow."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want the system to automatically categorize incoming emails based on a list of categories I define, so that I can process them more efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new email is received from SendGrid, **When** the system processes it, **Then** the email is classified into one of the predefined categories.
2. **Given** a user wants to change the categories, **When** they update the category list, **Then** the system uses the new list for classifying subsequent emails.
3. **Given** an email is classified, **When** a user views their emails, **Then** the email is organized according to its assigned category.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an email cannot be classified into any category? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a default 'unclassified' category, or should it be flagged for manual review?]
- How does the system handle a high volume of emails at once? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance targets and rate limiting are not specified]
- What happens if the SendGrid integration fails? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Error handling and notification mechanisms are not specified]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST receive emails from a SendGrid webhook.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to create, update, and delete categories in a hierarchical structure.
- **FR-003**: System MUST use a zero-shot AI model to classify emails against the user-defined categories.
- **FR-004**: System MUST organize classified emails. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are emails organized? (e.g., moved to folders, tagged, etc.)]
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a way for users to view the organized emails.
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle emails that cannot be classified. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Behavior for unclassifiable emails is not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Email**: Represents an email received by the system, including sender, subject, body, and its assigned category.
- **Category**: Represents a user-defined category for classification. It can have a parent category to form a hierarchy.
