# Implementation Plan: Automated Email Classification

**Branch**: `001-an-automated-system` | **Date**: 2025-09-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-an-automated-system/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This feature will introduce an automated email classification system. It will receive emails from SendGrid, classify them using a zero-shot AI model from Hugging Face, and categorize them based on a user-defined two-level hierarchy. The implementation will be a Node.js/TypeScript API using Express, Prisma, and MySQL, deployed and developed within Docker containers. Unclassified emails will be assigned to a default 'unclassified' category.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js v18, TypeScript v5
**Primary Dependencies**: Express, Prisma, @huggingface/inference, BullMQ, Redis
**Storage**: MySQL
**Testing**: Jest
**Target Platform**: Docker containers (Linux)
**Performance Goals**: Handle at least 10 requests per second.
**Constraints**: p99 latency under 500ms.
**Scale/Scope**: Designed for a single user/team to manage their email workflow.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (api)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? No, this is a service.
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Yes

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0
- BUILD increments on every change? No
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application (backend)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Completed. See [research.md](research.md).

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Completed. See [data-model.md](data-model.md), [contracts/openapi.yaml](contracts/openapi.yaml), and [quickstart.md](quickstart.md).

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base.
- Generate tasks from the Phase 1 design documents:
  - For each endpoint in `contracts/openapi.yaml`, create a contract test task.
  - For each model in `data-model.md`, create a Prisma model implementation task.
  - For each user story in `spec.md`, create an integration test task.
  - For each test, create a corresponding implementation task to make the test pass.
  - Create tasks for setting up the project structure, CI/CD pipeline, and deployment.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests will be created before the implementation.
- Dependency order:
  1. Project setup and database schema.
  2. Model and service layer implementation.
  3. API endpoint implementation.
- Tasks that can be done in parallel will be marked.

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in `tasks.md`.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
No violations to report.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
