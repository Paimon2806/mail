**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create attactment analyser. I want to create a tool that converts any attachment into plain text that can be then given to email_classifier. Image , pdf , docs anything. consider every posibility."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - (P1) Convert common file types to plain text

As a user, I want to be able to upload an attachment (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and have it converted into plain text, so that it can be processed by the email_classifier.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the tool.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by uploading a file of each supported type and verifying that the output is plain text.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PDF file, **When** it is uploaded, **Then** the system returns the plain text content of the file.
2. **Given** a DOCX file, **When** it is uploaded, **Then** the system returns the plain text content of the file.
3. **Given** a TXT file, **When** it is uploaded, **Then** the system returns the plain text content of the file.

### User Story 2 - (P2) Convert images to plain text

As a user, I want to be able to upload an image (PNG, JPG) and have the text in the image extracted into plain text, so that it can be processed by the email_classifier.

**Why this priority**: This extends the functionality of the tool to handle a common attachment type.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by uploading an image containing text and verifying that the output is the extracted plain text.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PNG file containing text, **When** it is uploaded, **Then** the system returns the extracted plain text.
2. **Given** a JPG file containing text, **When** it is uploaded, **Then** the system returns the extracted plain text.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an unsupported file type is uploaded?
- How does the system handle encrypted or password-protected files?
- What happens when a file with no text content is uploaded (e.g., a blank image)?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept file uploads up to 50 MB.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support the following file types: PDF, DOCX, TXT, PNG, JPG.
- **FR-003**: System MUST convert the content of supported files into plain text.
- **FR-004**: System MUST return the plain text content to the user.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle errors gracefully (e.g., unsupported file type, corrupted file).

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Attachment**: Represents the uploaded file, including its content and metadata (e.g., filename, file type, size).
- **PlainText**: Represents the extracted plain text content.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of supported files are converted to plain text with at least 99% accuracy.
- **SC-002**: The system can process 100 concurrent requests with an average response time of under 5 seconds.
- **SC-003**: The system can be easily integrated with the email_classifier.
