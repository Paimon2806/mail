# Prepr Vault Backend API Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Secure by Design
Security is a primary consideration in all aspects of development. This includes using established authentication mechanisms (Firebase), securing sensitive operations (PIN), using secure file handling (S3 presigned URLs), and preventing common vulnerabilities (input validation, TypeORM for SQL injection protection).

### II. Comprehensive API
The system will expose its functionality through a well-documented, RESTful API. This API should be comprehensive, covering all aspects of the system's functionality, and include interactive documentation (Swagger).

### III. Data-Centric Architecture
The system is built around a clear and well-defined data model, using TypeORM to manage database interactions. All features are ultimately manipulations of this data model.

### IV. Extensible and Modular
The codebase is organized into modules with clear responsibilities (controllers, services, repositories). This modularity allows for easier extension and maintenance.

### V. Observability
The application must be monitorable, with comprehensive logging, error tracking, and performance metrics.

## Development Workflow

All new features and bug fixes must follow the established development workflow, which includes:
- Creating a feature branch for all changes.
- Writing tests and ensuring they pass before merging.
- Running linting and formatting tools to maintain code quality.
- Submitting a pull request for review.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for all development practices. Amendments to this constitution require documentation, approval from the development team, and a migration plan if necessary. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with this constitution.
